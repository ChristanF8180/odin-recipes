   <h2>Arepas de Huevo</h2>
   <p>To make Colombian runny arepas de huevo, start by mixing pre-cooked cornmeal (masarepa), warm water, and a pinch of salt in a bowl until you have a smooth, soft dough. Shape the dough into small balls and flatten them into thick discs. Heat oil in a deep pan and fry each arepa until it puffs up and turns golden on both sides. Remove and carefully slit open one edge to create a small pocket. Crack a fresh egg into the opening, then gently seal the edge by pinching the dough together. Return the arepa to the hot oil and fry again until fully cooked and crisp, allowing the egg inside to remain slightly runny. Drain on paper towels, sprinkle with a little salt, and enjoy them hot for breakfast or as a savory snack.</p>
